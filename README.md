# bamazon


This app is a mockup of Amazon. When you run this application on the command line(using: <strong>node bamazonCustomer</strong>), it will have a table of clothing items the user is able to purchase. The user will be prompted to: “Enter the Product Id of the item you wish to buy.” Once the id number is entered then it will ask: “How many items would you like to purchase?” The user will need to input a number. The app will then determine if there is enough in stock. If there isn’t it will let the customer know. If there is, the transaction will go through and MySql Workbench will also be updated.
